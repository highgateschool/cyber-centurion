# Linux

Linux is the name given to the project started by Linus Torvalds in 1990 to build a POSIX compliant UNIX environment, built entirely from code which is unconstrained by commercial licenses. He started with the *kernel*, which is the core code that enables the operating system to communicate with the computer's components - the CPU, disk drive, mouse etc. You can see the effect of this by looking in the ```/dev``` and ```/sys``` folders. Like all UNIX systems, the peripherals are made accessible to the operating systems using filenames.
